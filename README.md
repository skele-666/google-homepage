This project's aim was to put into practice all the HTML/CSS skills I learned up until this point, and rebuild the [Google homepage](google.com). When first starting the project, I had no idea what to to do first. Do I start with the nav bar? Or do I do all the HTML first? Eventually, I found my rythm and completed the challenge.

Even though I got very frustrated at some points, this project was very fun. :)
